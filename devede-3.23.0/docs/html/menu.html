<h3>Menu options</h3>

<p>DeVeDe allows to add a menu to the video DVDs. This menu will allow to jump to each title. Here you can see
the default menu, with two titles:</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="menu.jpg" /></div></p>

<p>If you click the <b>Menu options</b> button in the main window, you will see this:</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="menu_opts.jpg" /></div></p>

<p>The first block allows you to add a title to your menu. This title will be shown at the upper part of the menu,
always centered. You can choose the font type and color, and you can add a shadow under it with the color
you want. You can freely choose the font size too, because the title will never touch the menu entries.</p>

<p>When choosing a color you can set the transparency level using the <b>Opacity</b> option. If this value is
set to 0, that color will be fully transparent, so the element with that color will be invisible. If this value
is 255, that color will be fully opaque. With other values the element will be semitransparent, allowing to
"see through" it. An example: if you don't want DeVeDe to add the black background rectangles under each title,
just set its opacity to 0, rendering it invisible.</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="menu_trans.jpg" /><br/><h5>When the opacity is set to 0, that color
is transparent, so the element rendered with it will be invisible.</h5></div></p>

<p>The second block allows you to change the background picture. This way you can create a custom menu
for your DVD. You can use all picture formats supported by Gnome. Clicking the <b>Set default background</b> will
set again the default picture used by DeVeDe: a white background with a DVD disk.</p>

<p>The third block allows to choose a sound file to use as soundtrack for the menu. By default the menus use
a file with 38 seconds of pure silence, but you can change it, having this way menus with music. Again, the
<b>Set menus without sound</b> button will restore the original silence file.</p>

<p>The next block allows you to choose the alignment. You can put the list of titles in the top, middle or bottom
of the screen; you can also choose to put them left, center or right aligned too. In the right part, you can set the
margins for the menus. The value is set as percentage, so a value of 10 in the top margin will mean "10% from the
top of the screen".</p>

<p>In the next block allows you to change the font style and size, and the colors used to render the inactive
text, the active text, the text background color and the shadow color. Again you can use transparency, in order to
remove the elements you don't want.</p>

<p>Here you must be carefull: you can only change the font size, not the button size, so if you make it too big,
you will have a menu like this:</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="menu_bad.jpg" /><br/><h5>You must be carefull with the font size, or
you will get incorrect results like this.</h5></div></p>

<p>The optimal font size is 12 points, but maybe for some special fonts it can be different, so always
use the <b>Preview menu</b> button to ensure that everything has the desired size.</p>

<p>Finally the last block allows to decide if you want the menu to be shown when you put the disk in the
player, or only when you press the <b>Menu</b> button in the remote. In the later case, when the disk is inserted
it starts to play the first title.</p>

<p>Let's see an example. Let's create a menu with the following options:</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="menu_opts2.jpg" /></div></p>

<p>Here we set the background color to fully transparent, added yellow shadows to the titles list, and set a
red ink with a black shadow to the title. We also moved the menu to the left. The result is here:</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="menu_example.jpg" /></div></p>
