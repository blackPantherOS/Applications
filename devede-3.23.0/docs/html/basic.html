<p><h2>Creating a disk: fast instructions</h2></p>

<p>Before explaining all the options in DeVeDe, I'll give you the common sequence to create a disk.</p>

<p>First, you choose the disk type you want to create (DVD, VCD, sVCD, CVD or DivX). Then, you drag&amp;drop
the files you want in the main window, creating (if is a DVD) the titles you want, or add them one-each-time
with the <b>Add file</b> button.</p>

<p>If you want to add subtitles or fine-tune the properties of a file, you should use the <b>Properties</b> button.</p>

<p>Then you should click the <b>Adjust disk usage</b> button. This will automatically set the video bitrate for each
file (which depends on the final size of the file, if it has one or more subtitles, if it's already a converted
file...).</p>

<p>After that, use the <b>Menu preview</b> button to ensure that you like the menu that DeVeDe will create. If not,
you can use the <b>Menu options</b> button to change them. Remember that the menu will use the names of the titles.</p>

<p>Finally, just click the <b>Forward</b> button, choose a destination directory and a name, and enjoy a good
coffee while DeVeDe works.</p>

<p>When the ISO or BIN/CUE file has been created, you can use K3b, GnomeBaker or Brasero to burn it. Under Gnome
(is possible that under KDE there's a simmilar option) you can right-click on the file and choose <b>Burn to disk</b>
too. Or you can use the safest option: command line:</p>

<p align="center">growisofs -dvd-compat -speed=4 -Z /dev/dvd=FILE.ISO</p>

<p>for ISO images, or:</p>

<p align="center">cdrdao write --device ATA:0,0,0 --driver generic-mmc --speed 16 NameOfCUEOrTOCFile</p>

<p>for BIN/CUE files.</p>

<h3>Storing and restoring the disc structure</h3>

<p>The options <b>Load</b>, <b>Save</b> and <b>Save as</b> in the <b>File</b> menu allow you to save
the current disk structure, in the case that you want continue your work later, or reuse it for another,
slightly different, disk. DeVeDe stores the disk format adding the extension <b>.devede</b>.</p>

<p>When you load a disk structure, DeVeDe checks that every file is still in its place. If there is a missing,
it will show an error message listing all the missing files (the complete path) and will refuse to load the
structure, to avoid incorrect results. There's a trick to still load it: just copy another movie to the
right directory and rename it with the right name, and after loading the structure, remove it from DeVeDe.</p>

<p>If the missing file is the menu background or the menu soundtrack, DeVeDe will load the structure anyway, but
showing a warning message and using the default background and/or soundtrack instead.</p>
